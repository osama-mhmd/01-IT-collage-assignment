    <p>
      Hello there ðŸ‘‹! We're DevJourney, your way to FAANG. Our idea started two
      years ago when we saw a lot of awesome developers sitting in their houses
      without jobs, and actually, the problems they are facing is really easy
      and just need a clarification. So, I started contacting my friends (most
      of them are seniors), and we decided to make DevJourney...

      At the beginning, I wanted it to be free. But after thinking, we realised
      that we cannot do this in a high-quality content, for a long term.. So we
      did that <a class="link" href="./pricing.html">See Pricing</a>
